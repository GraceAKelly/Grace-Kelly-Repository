#list all the natural numbers below 10 
#that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9.
#The sum of these multiples is 23.

#Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

x = 1
for i in range(1000): # all natural numbers below 1000
  if i % 3 == 0 or i % 5 == 0: # is is divisable by 3 or 5
    x += i
print (x)
